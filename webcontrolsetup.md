## Web Control Setup

This section shows you how to set up your computer to develop applications using the WorldWide Telescope web control.

### System Requirements

* Windows 7 or Windows 8 \(older versions of Windows are not supported\).
* Discrete graphics card with at least 512MB VRAM \(1GB VRAM recommended\), DirectX 10 or DirectX 11 compatibility. GTX 480 class or better is recommended.
* HTML editing software of your choice.

To ensure that the WorldWide Telescope web control works on your system, run the [WWT Web Client Simple](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/docs/Samples/wwtwebclientsimpleUIHtml5.html) sample.

### Data Preparation Tools

Data tools are included with the [WorldWide Telescope May 2009 ADK](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/wwt-ap/resources.aspx). Once installed these tools are available in the Programs menu under \*\*Microsoft Research.

## Web Control Development

This section explains the basic elements of a WorldWide Telescope web client application.


### Simple Web Control Walkthrough

Setting up a web page to host the WorldWide Telescope web control is simple. There are four key things that need to happen.

1. Link to the WorldWide Telescope script in the document **head**:

   ```html
   <script src="https://wwtstaging.azurewebsites.net/webclient/sdk/wwtsdk.min.js" type="text/javascript">
   </script>
   ```

2. Declare a variable for the web control, and add a function to initialize the control and call the ready event function:

   ```js
   var wwt;

   function initialize() {
     wwt = wwtlib.WWTControl.initControl("WWTCanvas");
     wwtControl.add_ready(wwtReady;)
   }
   ```

3. Add a ready event function. This is where you can place your own custom initialization code. Note that a call to `wwtControl.loadImageCollection` is already there. This call loads the default complete image collection when the control loads.

   ```js
   function wwtReady() {
       wwtControl.loadImageCollection("http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/COMPLETE/wwtcomplete.wtml");
       // Put your custom initialization code here.
   }
   ```

4. Set up the body of the HTML document to call `initialize()` on load, and add a **div** to contain the control. The WorldWide Telescope object uses the HTML5 Canvas element to display the control. Note that div tag should be sized at a minimum of 750px x 750px to accommodate the web client. This will prevent the view from being cropped.

   ```html
   <body onload="initialize()" >
       <div id="WWTCanvas" style="width:750px; height:750px; border-style: none; border-width: 0px;">
   ```

Now that you have the basics, take a look at other run-able samples in the [Web Control Samples](samples.md) section. Start out with the [WWT Web Client Simple sample](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/docs/worldwidetelescopewebcontrolscriptreference.html#WWTWebClientSimple), which takes our basic example a step further and adds a simple user interface to the mix.
